# Personal-Projects
Hi everyone! This is where I will be posting personal projects for me in order to get better at Python. 
I will be working on as much projects as I can with as little help as possible!

#Change Return Program 1/30/2020

For my first personal project, I created a change return program that asks you the cost of the item, 
the amount of money given and then calcuates the difference!(Amount of change needed). I was able to solve about half of this
project on my own with exception of googling certain terms to familiarize myself.

What I got stuck on was trying to figure out how to use my type_money dictionary to show how many Dollars, Dimes, etc. to
give out. I attempted to use a for loop while iterating through the dictionary, but that didn't work out as I was using
floaters as oppose to integars.

I eventually caved in and seeked out help using my good friend pythontutor.com. The user that joined my session was able to
explain that I can use a while loop with if statements to count down to my "change" value to 0, using my dictionary. This code
is showed in between the #### signs. The user also multiplied "money" and "cost" by 100, so that I'm working with integars.
Then switched back to floater value by dividing back by 100. By multipying money and cost by 100, it made my code much more 
easier to handle than when I was trying to write out the code using floater values.

Despite seeking out help halfway through the project, I am happy that I was able to semi complete this project on my own.
Hopefully my future projects won't require as much help!
